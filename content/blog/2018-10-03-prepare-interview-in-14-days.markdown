title: Day 0 - Prepare Interview in 14 days

I've got a pretty serious interview coming in around 14 days.

And considering how ill-prepared I am, I genuinely have zero faith on that I am going to pass that interview. So I decide to keep a diary like this everyday starting from now, to keep track of what I have done to prepare my interview, hoping when I looked back in the future, failed the interview, would feel less regret knowing that I have tried.

# What to prepare

I am using the well-known *Cracking the Code Interview* as a guideline. And after reading the first part of that book, I decided to prepare for the following sections:

1. Behavioral Questions    
    1. Tell me about a time when you are doing this project...
    2. What's your thoughts / questions about this job / company... 
2. **Actual Coding**! 

# About coding section

Before I jump into the never-ending coding practices, I think it's better to make a plan first. And today I'd like to outline what I should prepare for the coding sections in an interview, since this is the most significant part of an interview.

Generally, it breaks down into 3 sections:

1. Data Structure
2. Algorithm
3. System Design

Before I start my 14-day dash, I'd like to take a note about how much I already know, serving as the baseline.

1. **Data Structure**
    2. List
        3. Array
        4. Linked-list
        5. Stack
        6. Queue
        7. Hash Table
        7. Heap [?]
    3. Tree
        4. Binary [search] Tree / N-node Tree
        5. Prefix Tree / Tries [?]
        6. Segment Tree [?]
    4. Graph [?]
        5. Weighted / Unweighted, directed / undirected
2.  **Algorithm**
    3. General
        4. Divide and conquer [?]
        4. DP [?]
        4. Bit manipulation [?]
        5. Time / Space complexity analysis
    3.  List
        4. Searching
            5. Binary Search
            6. Two pointers
        5. [Sorting](https://github.com/asvrada/common-sorting-algorithms)
            6. Bubble Sort
            6. All other sorts [?]: Select Sort, Insert Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort
    4. Tree
        6.  Pre-, In-, Post-order traverse
            1. Recursive
            2. Non-recursive
        7. Level order traverse
        8. Insertion / Updating / Balancing [?]
    5. Graph
        6. DFS, BFS
        7. Shortest Path
3. **System Design**
    4. Design Pattern
    5. [TBD]

These marked with [?] represent ideas I can't quite remember.

You see, I don't actually know a lot! And you probably are way better than me! If I can find an worthy interview, so do you. **Just, try.**

> Tip:  
> The coding interview would always requires you to write some codes on whiteboard or on Google Docs. So be sure to be comfortable coding without the help of a fancy editor.

Today is all about familiar myself with the process of an interview, so no actual coding for now.

See you tomorrow!
