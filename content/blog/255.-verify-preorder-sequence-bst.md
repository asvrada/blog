Question: https://leetcode.com/problems/verify-preorder-sequence-in-binary-search-tree/

Post: https://leetcode.com/problems/verify-preorder-sequence-in-binary-search-tree/discuss/1127765/java-stack-10-lines-of-code-on-7ms

We want to check that if the binary search tree constructed from the pre-order traverse is valid, i.e the `left child < root < right child` . We use a stack to store the value of `root` we have seen so far, and an additional variable `prev` to store the previous value poped from stack, so that we can check if right child is always `>  root`

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean verifyPreorder(int[] preorder) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        int prev = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        for (int each: preorder) {
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() < each) {
                prev = stack.pop();
            }
            
            if (prev > each) {
                return false;
            }
                
            stack.add(each);
        }
    
        return true;
    }
}
```
