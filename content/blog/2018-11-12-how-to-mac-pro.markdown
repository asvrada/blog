This article shares some of the softwares I use that greatly improve the productivity on my Macbook Pro for programming & life.  

Some time ago I wrote a similiar article for iOS, you can check it out [here](https://asvrada.github.io/blog/2018/03/01/use-ipad-productively.html).

# Must have

## 1. [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com)

This is the best, the most powerful tool you can find on your macOS, seriously. Download & install it right now before you read on, come on, you won't regret it.

For short, this app can replace the built-in spotlight function. But there is much more to it. I mapped control + space (^ + space) to bring up the prompt, because I found this is the most convenient.

### 1. Launch your applications  

I personally use it to launch **every single** application, when it's simply much faster to type in the name (part of it is sufficient) into the alfred and launch one app, why bother looking for it in the launchpad or even docker?

Launch apps lightning fast.

### 2. Control your system  

One advantage for Alfred compared to built-in spotlight is that you can use it to do some system level stuff, simply by typing the command into the prompt.

Above is my current configuration. I could easily empty my trash, restart or shut down my computer or quit all the applications in style. But I found the "Eject All" command most helpful, it allows you to eject all disks that you currently opened, like app installer (which is a pain to mannually eject each of them after install), or external harddrivers connected to your computer.

### 3. Web search

Not only I use this to launch all the apps, also I use it to directly search for something online like Google or wiki. For example, you could type in "google foo bar" and hit return, it will bring you straight into the search result on google.

Actually you can use it as a launcher for websites without actually search anything. 

I created shortcuts for some of my most frequently used websites, so I can access them with some simple types without opening the browser and type in their addresses or reach for the bookmarks!

### 4. And much more!
You could literally do anything with Aflred with the power of custom Workflows. 

I personally installed a translation workflow that if I type a english word, it will show its definition in Chinese. Literally life saving.

## 2. [IINA](https://lhc70000.github.io/iina/zh-cn/)

This is a nice and modern-look video player than can totally replace quicktime. It supports all the video formats you need, external close caption files, and more. This is definitly the right choice for your default video player.

## 3. [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/)

This, my friend, is magic. It allows you to manage & organize your opened windows like magic.

Have you ever tried to adjust and align every window so they don't overlap with each other? Have you ever opened so many window and get buried under them? Well, moom is for you (or even if you don't, you still should totally have a try).

I create global shortcuts to do the following things for current window:

1. Fill fullsreen (but not entering fullscreen mode)
2. Fill one of the four corners, taking 25% space of the entire screen
3. Fill upper/lower half screen
4. Fill left/right half screen

I found them extremly handy while manging windows or making room for new windows, it's *wicked* fast and elegent. You will love it.

# For programmer

Since every programer has his own preferences, I am going to share my own set up.

1. **Brew**: the package manager that macOS needs. Basically its `apt-get` for macOS.
2. **Dash**: for document & API referencing
3. **Sublime Text editor**: for light coding ONLY. I highly recommend JetBrain's lineup for serious project developing.*
4. **Anaconda**: for python environment management.
5. **MacDown**: for markdown editing.
6. **texstudio**: for Latex editing. Remeber to install Latex environment before use!
7. **Postman**: for Web API testing
8. **iTerm2**: this thing replaces built-in Terminal. With some proper configuration its going to get you far.

Ok, thats all. If you got anything to recommend, please leave a comment below!
